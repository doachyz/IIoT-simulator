# IIoT Simulator: Advanced Industrial IoT Simulation for Smart Factories

Welcome to the IIoT Simulator GitHub repository. Here, you will find an advanced Industrial IoT (IIoT) simulator tailored for Smart Factory 4.0 environments. Using Python, MQTT, and Docker, this simulator emulates configurable production lines with realistic sensor data such as vibration, temperature, quality, and predictive alerts.

## Features
üîß Configure production lines with ease  
üìä Generate realistic sensor data  
‚ö†Ô∏è Receive predictive alerts  
üê≥ Dockerized for seamless deployment  

## How to Use
